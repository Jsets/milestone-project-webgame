web game project (1st milestone project)


Web game project using html css and javascript
I've decided to make a simple black jack game


The finished game should be able to let you start a game and either win or lose, and be able to 'hit' or 'stand'.

Cards should be dealt out maybe with a little bit of animation just depending on the time it takes me to creat the logic for the game.
